Originally built by Nate Moore ([@natemoo-re](https://github.com/natemoo-re)) as an experimental package, Astro Icon would not be what it is today without the support of the larger Astro community.

A very special thank you to Michael Stramel ([@stramel](https://github.com/stramel)) for his help maintaining Astro Icon, spear-heading the v1 release, and providing great user support during the transition to v1. 

## Libraries

Astro Icon would not be possible without [Iconify](https://iconify.design/), an open source effort to distribute thousands of icon sets in a normalized format.

Please consider [sponsoring Iconify](https://iconify.design/sponsors/) to support this ongoing effort.
