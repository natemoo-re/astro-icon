import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will help you migrate from older versions of `astro-icon` to `astro-icon` v1.

There are multiple breaking changes in `astro-icon` v1 that require changes to your existing code. This guide will outline the steps you must take.

### History

The original version of `astro-icon` was built in December 2021, when Astro had not even released a stable v1. Every Astro project was, by definition, a static site. Server-side rendering was not a supported feature and there was no official API for integrations. `astro-icon`'s architecture reflected the reduced scope that Astro had at the time.

In v1, `astro-icon` has been refactored to provide a more stable foundation that supports everything Astro v3+ is capable of, including server-side rendering.

## Upgrade `astro-icon`

Update your projectâ€™s version of `astro-icon` to the latest version using your package manager.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh ins="latest"
npm install astro-icon@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh ins="latest"
pnpm add astro-icon@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh ins="latest"
yarn add astro-icon@latest
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Breaking Changes

### Changed: `astro-icon` is now an integration

In v0, the entire API surface was limited to the `Icon` and `Sprite` components.

In v1, `astro-icon` has become a full-fledged integration.

#### What should I do?

Update your `astro.config.mjs` file to include the new `astro-icon` integration.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins="import icon from \"astro-icon\";" ins="icon()"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import icon from "astro-icon";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [icon()],
});
```

### Removed: Remote API service

In v0, icons were automatically fetched from a custom Astro Icon API, powered internally by [Iconify](https://iconify.design/). While this was convenient, missing icons and network latency caused frequent problems.

In v1, icon sets **must** be installed as a dependency in your project.

#### What should I do?

Determine the icon sets (previously referred to as a "pack") used in your project. Install the equivalent `@iconify-json/<name>` package.

For example, if using the `mdi:account` and `carbon:basketball` icons, the `mdi` and `carbon` icons must be installed in your project.


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh mark="mdi" mark="carbon"
npm install @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/carbon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh mark="mdi" mark="carbon"
pnpm add @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/carbon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh mark="mdi" mark="carbon"
yarn add @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/carbon
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Changed: component export location

In v0, components were exported directly from the `astro-icon` package.

In v1, components are exported from the `astro-icon/components` path.

#### What should I do?

Update your import statements to reference `astro-icon/components`.

```js ins="/components"
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
```

### Changed: styling attribute

In v0, icons used an `astro-icon` attribute for styling. This was technically invalid HTML.

In v1, icons use the `data-icon` attribute instead.

#### What should I do?

Replace any `[astro-icon]` selectors in your styles with the equivalent `[data-icon]` selector.

```diff lang="html" del="astro" ins="data"
<style>
-  [astro-icon] {
+  [data-icon] {
    color: blue;
  }
-  [astro-icon="annotation"] {
+  [data-icon="annotation"] {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```

### Removed: `pack` prop

In v0, the `Icon` component accepted separate `pack` and `name` props plus a shorthand `pack:name` syntax.

In v1, the `Icon` component only accepts a `name` prop. Packs are always referenced via the shorthand `pack:name` syntax.

#### What should I do?

Update your components to replace the `pack` prop with the `name` prop.

```astro del="pack=\"mdi\"" ins="mdi:"
<Icon pack="mdi" name="mdi:account" />
```

### Removed: `Sprite` component

In v0, the `Sprite` component was used to generate an SVG spritesheet. This required your entire page to be wrapped in a `<Sprite.Provider>`.

In v1, the `Sprite` component has been removed. The `Icon` component now automatically optimizes itself into an SVG spritesheet when used multiple times on the same page.

#### What should I do?

Remove the `<Sprite.Provider>` wrapper from your pages. Replace any references to the `Sprite` component with the `Icon` component.

```diff lang="astro" del="Sprite," ins="Icon" ins="/components"
---
import { Sprite, Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
---

- <Sprite.Provider>
  <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
-      <Sprite name="building" />
+      <Icon name="building" />
    </body>
- </Sprite.Provider>
```

### Removed: `createIconPack` utilities

In v0, the `astro-icon/pack` module exported a `createIconPack` utility to create custom local icon packs from JS/TS files.

In v1, the `astro-icon/pack` module has been removed. Network and custom loaders are no longer supported. All icons must be placed in the `src/icons/` directory.

#### What should I do?

Remove any loaders that used `createIconPack`. Instead, create a new directory for each icon pack in the `src/icons/` directory and add one `.svg` file for each icon.

### Removed: `optimize` prop

In v0, the `Icon` component accepted an `optimize` prop, but it defaulted to `true`. This controlled the SVGO optimizations for specific icons.

In v1, the `optimize` prop has been removed. SVGO optimizations are automatically performed during the build rather than dynamically at runtime.

#### What should I do?

Remove any usage of the `optimize` prop. Configure SVGO optimization by passing `svgoOptions` to the `icon()` integration instead.

```astro del="optimize"
 <Icon name="mdi:account" optimize />
```

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {7-15}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import icon from "astro-icon";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    icon({
      svgoOptions: {
        plugins: [
          "preset-default",
          {
            name: "convertColors",
            params: { currentColor: true },
          },
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
