description: Using the Icon component
---

Astro Icon's main API is an `Icon` component that automatically inlines an `<svg>` directly in your markup.

## Icon

You can use the `Icon` component by importing it from `astro-icon/components` and rendering it as a normal [Astro Component](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

```astro mark="Icon" {6}
---
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
---

<!-- Embed the contents of the `/src/icons/logo.svg` file -->
<Icon name="logo" />
```

Because `astro-icon` is powered by Astro, this component only renders on the server to static HTML. It has no runtime footprint.

### Props

The `Icon` component accepts the following properties:

```ts
interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<"svg"> {
  /** The name of the icon to include */
  name: string;
  /** Shorthand for including a <title>{props.title}</title> element in the SVG */
  title?: string;
  /** Shorthand for setting width and height */
  size?: number | string;
  width?: number | string;
  height?: number | string;
}
```

The `Icon` also accepts any global HTML attributes and `aria` attributes. They will be forwarded to the rendered `<svg>` element.

### Automatically optimized sprites

Because Astro controls the entire rendering lifecycle for a given `Request`, `astro-icon` is able to automatically optimize repeated references to the same icon on a page.

The approach uses a novel take on the more traditional [SVG Sprite](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/) system that leverages a single `<svg>` sprite for your entire site. The first time the `Icon` component is included on a page, it defines a sprite [`<symbol>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/symbol) with a unique ID and immediately renders that symbol with the [`<use>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use) element. If the same icon is referenced again, `Icon` will render only a `<use>` element, reducing the overall size of your HTML document by referencing the existing `<symbol>`.

```astro
---
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
---

<Icon name="logo" />
<!-- First usage generates the following HTML -->
<svg data-icon="logo">
	<symbol id="ai:uniqueid"><!-- contents of /src/icons/logo.svg --></symbol>
	<use href="#ai:uniqueid"></use>
</svg>

<Icon name="logo" />
<!-- Additional usage generates the following HTML -->
<svg data-icon="logo">
	<use href="#ai:uniqueid"></use>
</svg>
```

## Usage with Framework Components

The `<Icon />` component, like any other Astro component, cannot be used directly in [UI framework components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/).

But, you can pass the static content generated by `<Icon />` to a framework component inside a `.astro` file as children or using a [named `<slot/>`](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#can-i-use-astro-components-inside-my-framework-components):

```astro
---
import ReactComponent from './ReactComponent.jsx'
import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components"
---

<ReactComponent>
  <Icon name="logo" />
</ReactComponent>
```
