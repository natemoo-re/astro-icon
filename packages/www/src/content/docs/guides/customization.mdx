import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Astro Icon is designed to support custom icons that exist as `.svg` files in your project. 
It also supports any open source icon set distributed by [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

## Local icons

Add new icons to your site by creating `.svg` files in `/src/icons/`.
Use sub-folders to organize your files and create multiple sets of icons.

Icons in the `/src/icons/` directory can be automatically referenced by their slug, for example:

```astro mark="/src/icons/logo.svg" mark="logo" mark="/src/icons/logos/astro.svg" mark="logos/astro"
---
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
---

<!-- Embed the contents of the `/src/icons/logo.svg` file -->
<Icon name="logo" />

<!-- Embed the contents of the `/src/icons/logos/astro.svg` file -->
<Icon name="logos/astro" />
```

Local `.svg` files are automatically optimized with [`svgo`](https://github.com/svg/svgo). Specific `svgo` options can be [configured in the integration](/reference/configuration).

## Open Source Icon Sets

[Iconify](https://iconify.design/) is a project that distributes normalized packages of open source icon sets.
After installing an icon set in your project, icons will be automatically available to the `Icon` component.

### Find an icon set

Visit the official [Iconify Icon Sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) explorer or the popular [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/) app to browse the available icon sets.

### Install dependency

After identifying the icon set you would like to use, you must install the corresponding `@iconify-json/*` package.

As an example, to install the [Material Design Icons](https://icones.js.org/collection/mdi) set, run the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install @iconify-json/mdi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add @iconify-json/mdi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add @iconify-json/mdi
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Using an icon set

Installed icon sets can be automatically referenced by their prefixed id, for example:

```astro mark="@iconify-json/mdi" mark="mdi:account"
---
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'
---

<!-- Embed the `account` icon from `@iconify-json/mdi` -->
<Icon name="mdi:account" />
```

### Using multiple icon sources

You are not limited to a single icon source!

- You may mix and match local icons with an `@iconify-json/*` icon set.
- You may install multiple `@iconify-json/*` icon sets.

:::danger
**If your Astro project uses the `server` or `hybrid` output**, be mindful that every icon that could _potentially_ be referenced will be included in your server's JavaScript bundle by default!

Reference the [Deployment](/guides/deployment/) guide to understand how to optimize your final server bundle size.
