Astro Icon supports every deployment method that Astro supports. Refer to the official [Deploy your Astro Site](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) guide for specific instructions.

## Rendering Modes

Astro projects support multiple [Rendering Modes](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/rendering-modes/), pages, routes, and API endpoints can be either [pre-rendered at build time](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/rendering-modes/#pre-rendered) or [rendered on demand by a server](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/rendering-modes/#on-demand-rendered) when a route is requested.

### Pre-rendered

Astro projects that are entirely pre-rendered do not need any special configuration to use Astro Icon.

### On-demand rendered

Astro projects that have [enabled on-demand server rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#enable-on-demand-server-rendering) should take special when using Astro Icon.

By default, all `@iconify-json/*` packages will be bundled into your server code, potentially bloating your server JavaScript bundles.

For complete control over the size of your bundle, it is **highly recommended** to [configure the `include` option](/reference/configuration#include) to enable only your required icons.
